    This sculpture came out of a very long “passion hiatus”. <br> 
    Depression had me in a chokehold, but as time went on, <br>
    its grip loosened on my neck. Before RWTE, I made art <br>
    not for the joy of making it, but to pass the class. <br>
    With this sculpture, I was finally free to enjoy who I <br>
    am and enjoy art. There is no special meaning; there is <br>
    no secret symbolism; there is no nothing. Just here for <br>
    our viewing pleasure.
