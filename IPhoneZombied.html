This was my first website. Go easy on me. <br>
This is a flarf poem using the text: <br> 
â€œok actually maybe class pet would be nice. i want one of those human sized dog beds." <br> 
...except I deleted the part about the <br>
beds. If you are on the fence about <br> 
purchasing a human dog, maybe this <br> 
advertisement could help persuade you!
